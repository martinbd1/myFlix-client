Using React, built the client-side for an application called myFlix based on its previsouly created server-side code (REST API and database). 

## Overview

The application was built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. This is the frontend component of a “movies” web application. The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

This repo is the front end of the application. The backend of the application can be found here:
